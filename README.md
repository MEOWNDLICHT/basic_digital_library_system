PROJECT NAME: LIBRARY SIMULATION PROGRAM
CREATED BY: MEOW

The purpose of this project is to simulate a realistic online library system that supports basic CRUD operations for managing books, users, authors, and borrowing information. It includes two-way user authentication and role-based (librarian/member) access control to differentiate between user permissions.

IMPORT/PROGRAM FLOW DIAGRAM:
main.py -> services -> data -> model

main.py - handles the proper execution of everything
services - where the CRUD operations are properly handled and authenticated
data - where data is stored and updated
model - where the basic blueprints for accounts, users, and such are handled



GOODNIGHT~
